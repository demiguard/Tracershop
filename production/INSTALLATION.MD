# Installation of Tracershop production site
Installing the production tracershop is large task. Now this is sadly a rather complicated affair

## Footwork
As this is a python application ensure that you have python3.10
> `sudo apt install software-properties-common -y`
> `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa`
> `sudo apt install python3.10`

### Database
Because the database run on version 5.7 and that's ancient, you have to go through some hoops to install the mysql database

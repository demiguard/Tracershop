# Folder Description

This Folder should contain export injectable React Components, that is
used throughout all sub-sites.

An "Injectable" Component is a small sub component, that is useable for many
larger components. If two larger components have the same functionality favor
creating a smaller "Injectable" component. This ensure a streamlined user
experience.

Files should be name with snake case and each component should have a docstring
describing the component.

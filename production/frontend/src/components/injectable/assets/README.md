# Folder

This folder should contain wrapped resources producing components that can be
injected with the various things, that should modify them.

Note that the primary purpose of this is to move away from css files and use
inline css, svg's and so forth. This is to avoid static files, because they are
well, static and therefore cannot change dynamically. While it's unlikely that
I'll draw icons on the fly, or that you can even reason about a path in an svg,
there's still strength in the fact, that you can alter properties on the fly
are VERY useful.

Note that some of the things that have been drawn are just CSS, and maybe it's
better if they are drawn in SVG
